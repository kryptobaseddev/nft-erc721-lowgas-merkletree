# nft-erc721-lowgas-merkletree

Initial start to work on the pros/cons to implementing Merkle tree functionality into the ERC721 contract. I have committed an initial contract that is using Counters over the standard Enumerable to lower over all gas costs. This base lower gas contract standard is what I am using to head down the path for implementing merkle.
